# github-desktop-docset

A cheatset for GitHub Desktop unified client: https://desktop.github.com/

This is a WIP project. I'm doing this while using beta of unified GitHub Desktop native application both on Windows and Mac OS X. The Dash cheetsheet file will be PR to Kapeli's Dash cheatset.

## Development

```
sudo gem install cheatset
```

```
$ cheatset generate GitHub_Desktop.rb
```
